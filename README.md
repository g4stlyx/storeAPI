### <h1>Store API</h1>

I create this API to practise searching, filtering, sorting, and paginating data fetched from database. All this
is being done on back end, so on front end only thing you should do is fetching data with correct url and parameters.


### <h2>Setup</h2>

-create a file named ".env" which contains "MONGO_URI= <link-to-your-mongodb-db>" <br>
-navigate the folder containing package.json <br>
-npm install <br>
-npm start
